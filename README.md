# Lab project - A Beautiful Readme file

By [Lluis Badia Planes](https://github.com/lluis90badia), 8/2/2022

## The purpose of this lab is to re-submit a previous jupyter lab project, but this time to present it in a proper way (more professional). In this case, we will re-submit the lab 'Customer Analysis Round 1' (18/1/2022).

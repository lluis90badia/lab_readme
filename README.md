# Lab project - A Beautiful Readme file

By [Lluis Badia Planes](https://github.com/lluis90badia), 8/2/2022

## The purpose of this lab is to re-submit a previous jupyter lab project, but this time to present it in a proper way (more professional). In this case, we will re-submit the lab 'Customer Analysis Round 1' (18/1/2022).

## Brief explanation of the lab

To develop this lab, first of all, we created a new conda environment called 'class' because it will be there where we will do the labs using all the packages that Conda groups. Moreover, we went through some basics to work with the Jupyter Notebook. Finally, we learned about Pandas to be ready to perform the tasks in the lab.
